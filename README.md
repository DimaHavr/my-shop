# my-shop

The Next.js shop is a modern e-commerce  responsive website built with React, Redux Toolkit, Axios, and styled-components. It features a shopping cart that allows users to add, remove and update items. The website includes routing pages such as home, shop, cart, and favorite pages. Users can save their favorite items by clicking on a heart icon.

The website uses Redux Toolkit for state management, which simplifies Redux setup and reduces boilerplate code. Additionally, the website uses Redux Persist to persist the Redux store to local storage, allowing the website to remember the user's cart and favorites even after a refresh or when the user navigates away from the website.

The website uses Axios for making HTTP requests to a fake API, ensuring the website is highly scalable and robust. Finally, styled-components ensures the website has a consistent and visually appealing design.

Overall, the Next.js shop is a responsive and efficient e-commerce website that provides a seamless shopping experience. The use of Redux Toolkit and Redux Persist makes the website highly scalable and robust, allowing for a more seamless user experience.
